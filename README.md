# Sonos Alarms - KNX

Link your Sonos alarms to your KNX devices

### Prerequisites
This node module requires a running (and properly configured) **knx daemon (knxd)**. You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/knxd/knxd).  
I cannot support the knxd. Please address issues directly at the [knxd issue pages](https://github.com/knxd/knxd/issues). It might help to search the existing issues, as your problem might have been solved already.
